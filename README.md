I built this app as a way to dynamically evaluate S&P 500 company stocks and allow the user to choose which investment criteria they want to judge the company on. The user can select any number of criteria and give each criteria a custom weight of their choosing.

The app will calculate what percentile your selected company ranks at compared to the rest of the S&P 500 companies for each criteria, then show you a composite scored based on those percentiles. You can view an equal weighted score and a custom score based on the weights you have selected for your criteria.

To use the analysis tool do the following:
**NOTE** the large dataset for the app is loaded initially, this may take a few seconds
1) Choose a company from the S&P 500 from the dropdown list
2) Choose a criteria to evaluate that company on and enter a weighted value to give that criteria
3) Repeat step 2 for any number of criteria you would like to choose
4) Generate the chart!
